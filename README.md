## 🎨 Assets
This project uses free assets from [CraftPix](https://craftpix.net/):  
- [Free Drones Pack (Pixel Art)](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-drones-pack-pixel-art/?num=1&count=15&sq=drone&pos=1)  
- [Free Industrial Zone Tileset (Pixel Art)](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-industrial-zone-tileset-pixel-art/?num=1&count=26&sq=industrial&pos=4)  

## 🛠️ Game Logic
- The drone stays in place, with obstacles spawning to its right side and moving backwards to meet it, this along with background movement and parallax creates the illusion that the drone moves forward.
